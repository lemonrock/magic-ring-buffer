//! #magic-ring-buffer
//! 
//! This is a Rust crate providing a magic ring buffer (also known as a virtual ring buffer, VRB, or mirrored buffer) which is lock-free for multiple producers and a single consumer.
//!
//! A magic ring buffer allows 'wrap-around' of a ring buffer without the need to use two separate read or two separate writes; it exploits the fact that virtual memory does not need to be implemented using contiguous physical memory.
//!
//! The current implementation only works on Android and Linux, as it relies on mapping anonymous shared memory in `/dev/shm`.
//! It should be possible to make implementations that work on Mac OS X, the BSDs and Windows.
